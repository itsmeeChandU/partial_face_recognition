Note
------
I am not including dataset to repo because of

1. Permission is NOT granted to reproduce the database or posted it into any webpage that is not the AR face database web-page administreted by Prof. Aleix M. Martinez.

2. Written permission must be obtained from Prof. Aleix M. Martinez if a faculty member desires to share the database with her/his co-workers or students. Even then, the database cannot be posted on a web-page accessible from outside the faculty research group.

3. No economical profit can be made from this database.
